# 🐾 What is DevOps?

DevOps is a combination of **cultural philosophies, practices, and tools**  
that **increase an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services faster**.

It **bridges the gap between development and operations**, promoting **collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of DevOps

- **Improve collaboration** between developers and IT operations
- **Deliver software faster** and more reliably
- **Automate repetitive tasks**
- **Monitor and improve systems continuously**
- **Reduce errors and downtime**

---

## 🧩 Key Concepts

### 1️⃣ Culture
- DevOps is first about **people and collaboration**
- Encourages **shared responsibility** for software from development to production
- Promotes **open communication** and **teamwork**

### 2️⃣ Automation
- Automate repetitive tasks:
  - Building code
  - Running tests
  - Deploying applications
  - Monitoring systems
- Tools: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes

### 3️⃣ Continuous Processes
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Merging code frequently, running automated tests
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Automatically deploying code to production
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Observing application and system performance

### 4️⃣ Measurement & Feedback
- Track **performance metrics**
- Gather **user feedback**
- Continuously **improve processes**

## 🌐 DevOps Lifecycle

The typical DevOps lifecycle has **seven stages**:

1. **Plan** – Define features and tasks  
2. **Code** – Develop the application  
3. **Build** – Compile code and create packages  
4. **Test** – Automated testing to ensure quality  
5. **Release/Deploy** – Deliver to production environments  
6. **Operate** – Maintain, optimize, and improve production systems  
7. **Monitor** – Observe performance, gather metrics, and trigger feedback

Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor → Plan (continuous loop)
